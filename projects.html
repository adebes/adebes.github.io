                <h1>NET VALUE: VISUALIZING THE EVOLUTION OF SOCCER PLAYSTYLES</h1>
                <p>
                    Net Value is a visualization tool for understanding the evolution of soccer play styles. The
                    tool is meant to allow sports analysts to track the progression of player performance over multiple seasons. 
                    To achieve this, Net Value separates soccer players into various clusters. These clusters serve as 
                    profiles that encapsulate player perfomance and play style. The clustering model is trained on players across 
                    95 professional leagues over 15 seasons.

                    I worked on this project as part of my graduate studies, collaborating with 4 other colleagues. I experienced the entire data 
                    development process, from collection and processing data to synthesizing and presenting our results. We used Pandas to handle 
                    missing values and outliers, and to standardize metrics for fair player comparison. We leveraged PCA and k-Means for the 
                    clustering model, and t-SNE to project our dataset in 2D. The dashboard was built using Plotly Dash in order to create simple
                    but useful visualizations run on Python. The site is hosted on PythonAnywhere.

                <h1>DATA VISUALIZATION FOR DROUGHTS IN THE COLORADO RIVER</h1>
                <p>
                    Visualized historical drought levels in the Colorado River Basin and its effects on water supplies and local wildfires.
                    Built interactive map visualization on Tableau using drought and wildfire geospatial data with over 200k data points.
                    Graphed historical trends in drought across states and counties that depend on Colorado River water supplies.
                    Created ”scrolly-telling” presentation that revealed insights regarding the impact of drought in the local area.

                    Performed in-depth study of Tindall's inventory policy to maximized lot efficiency and reduce associated costs.
                    Modeled the company's stacking process using Simio simulation software to test various inventory policies.
                    Recommended more cost-efficient inventory policy that reduced inventory relocation costs by estimated 45%.
                    Documented approach and presented findings to client stakeholders and college faculty and students.
